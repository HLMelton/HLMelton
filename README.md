ðŸ‘‹ **Aloha! I'm Hunter L. Melton**

I make things with code on occasion, sometimes web applications for sending monkey photos to people, 
other times it's firmware for my robotic dog (Still working on the walking part).

Currently I'm based in the San Francisco Bay Area attending SJSU for Economics but 
judging by the fact that you are reading this, you may have guessed that finance and money isn't my only passion. 

Feel free to take a look at my repos if you're interested in any of the projects. Thanks for taking a look.
